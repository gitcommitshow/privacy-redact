## Why

We paste screenshots into **ChatGPT, Claude, Slack, Discord, GitHub issues and social media** all day. Every one of them can quietly contain a home address, a card number, a face that isn't yours, or a QR code that logs someone in. And the "fix" — drawing black boxes by hand in Paint or Photoshop — is tedious, easy to get wrong, and usually leaves the **EXIF/GPS/camera-serial metadata** untouched.

privacy-redact makes the safe thing the *easy* thing:

1. **Drop** any image or PDF (or paste a screenshot with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>).
2. **Auto-blur** — sensitive items are found and hidden for you. Click any box to un-hide it, drag to hide something we missed.
3. **Save** (or **Copy to clipboard**) — a clean file with zero metadata, verified before you share it.

> This repository is the library: detection, redaction, and document handling, plus browser components for OCR, faces, barcodes, and PDFs. The page in this repo is a harness for those components, not a brand. A small host that shows each call is in [examples/](examples/README.md).

### 🧼 Strips hidden data

Before you save, privacy-redact shows exactly what's hiding in your file — and what's about to disappear:

- 📍 GPS coordinates & altitude
- 📷 Camera / phone model, 🔢 body & lens **serial numbers**
- 🕒 Original capture & edit dates
- 👤 Owner / author / copyright, 🛠️ editing software
- 📄 PDF title, author, producer, keywords, dates
- XMP / IPTC blocks, embedded thumbnails, ICC profiles

After export it **re-opens the file it just wrote** and checks that no metadata is left ("re-checked: 0 metadata fields in the output").

### 🎨 Aesthetic, adjustable redaction

- **Blur** (default) – soft, pretty, and irreversible (see [How redaction stays irreversible](#-how-redaction-stays-irreversible))
- **Pixelate** – classic mosaic
- **Blackout** – maximum-paranoia solid fill
- **Strength slider**, per-category switches, click-to-toggle on any box, drag-to-add manual boxes
- **Hold to compare** with the original · multi-page PDFs with page navigation

### 🔒 Private by design

- **Everything runs in your browser tab** — OCR (Tesseract), face detection (TensorFlow.js), barcode decoding (ZXing), PDF rendering (PDF.js).
- Models, WASM and fonts are **bundled** – no CDN calls at runtime. Works fully offline after first load.
- Production builds ship a strict **Content-Security-Policy** (`connect-src 'self'`, `form-action 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`) so the page is *technically unable* to send your file anywhere.
- The end-to-end test fails if the app makes even one request to another origin.
- No analytics, no cookies, no accounts, no telemetry.

## Quick start

### Run it locally

```bash
npm install          # also copies the OCR / face / PDF assets into public/vendor
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:5173
```

Production build (static files, host anywhere — S3, Netlify, `python -m http.server`, a USB stick):

```bash
npm run build        # → dist/
npm run preview      # serve dist/ at http://localhost:4173
```

Requires Node 18+ and a modern browser (Chrome/Edge 119+, Firefox 121+, Safari 17.4+).

### Desktop app (experimental)

A tiny Electron shell is included. It serves the built app from a loopback-only server and **blocks every non-local network request**.

```bash
npm run desktop        # build + launch
npm run desktop:pack   # installers via electron-builder (dmg / nsis / AppImage) → release/
```

> The desktop wrapper hasn't had the same test coverage as the web app yet — PRs and bug reports welcome.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Drop image / PDF] --> B[Decode to canvas<br/>EXIF-orientation applied<br/>PDF pages rasterised]
    B --> C1[OCR<br/>Tesseract.js]
    B --> C2[Faces<br/>SSD-MobileNet]
    B --> C3[Barcodes / QR<br/>ZXing]
    C1 --> D[Pattern engine<br/>regex + Luhn + labels]
    D --> E[Word boxes → pixel rects]
    C2 --> F[Regions]
    C3 --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Live preview<br/>blur / pixelate / blackout]
    G --> H[Export from raw pixels<br/>PNG · JPG · flattened PDF]
    H --> I[Re-open & verify<br/>0 metadata fields]
```

1. **Decode.** Images become a canvas (transparency flattened, EXIF orientation baked in). PDFs are rendered page-by-page at 144 dpi.
2. **Detect.** OCR yields words with bounding boxes. Screenshots are upscaled and dark themes inverted first to help the OCR. Each line is scanned with the rule set in [`src/detect/patterns.js`](src/detect/patterns.js); matches are mapped back to pixels — even partial words like `Email:jane@x.com` are trimmed to just the address.
3. **Review.** Every detection is a box you can toggle. Categories can be switched off wholesale.
4. **Export.** The redacted canvas is re-encoded from scratch and re-checked.

## 💥 How redaction stays irreversible

Bad redaction is worse than none, so:

- **Blur and pixelate average pixels into blocks first** (only ~1–2.4 cells across a line of text, ~5–11 across a face), add random per-block noise, and only *then* smooth. The original detail is discarded, not merely obscured — there is nothing to "un-blur". Text cells are deliberately coarser than a glyph because fine mosaics of a known font can be brute-forced back into text ([Depix](https://github.com/spipm/Depix)-style attacks); the jitter stops exact colour matching.
- **Nothing is layered.** The output image is a new set of pixels. There is no hidden original underneath a box, unlike PDF "highlight" annotations that can be deleted.
- **PDFs are flattened.** Each page is rasterised, redacted and re-embedded as an image, so the text layer beneath a redaction no longer exists. (The trade-off: exported PDFs aren't text-selectable.)
- **Nothing is copied byte-for-byte from your source file**, so EXIF, XMP, IPTC, thumbnails and PDF info dictionaries can't tag along. PDFs are written with metadata auto-stamping disabled (no `Producer`, no dates).
- The e2e suite **OCRs the exported file** and asserts that the SSN, email, phone, card, address and account numbers of the sample document are no longer readable.

> Want zero doubt for something extremely sensitive? Pick **Blackout** and drag the strength up.

## Limitations — please read

privacy-redact is a safety net, not a guarantee. **Always glance at the preview before sharing.**

- **Names aren't detected.** Names are context-dependent and would cause a lot of false positives with regex-only detection. Use the drag-to-hide tool (a local NER model is on the [roadmap](#roadmap)).
- **OCR isn't perfect.** Tiny fonts, low contrast, unusual fonts, handwriting, rotated or curved text can be missed. A digit misread by OCR can still leave a card *pattern* undetected if it's badly broken up.
- **English-first.** Address rules are US/Canada/UK oriented; phone rules include international formats; OCR uses the English model.
- **Faces:** heavily rotated, occluded or tiny faces can be missed; non-faces occasionally trigger. Wide images are scanned in overlapping tiles so small faces are found, at the cost of speed. Toggle boxes to correct.
- **Barcodes:** without the native `BarcodeDetector` API (Chrome on Windows/Linux, Firefox), 1D codes are located via scan-line heuristics and a structure check that rejects text mistaken for bars. Damaged or very small codes can be missed.
- **Not detected by design:** license plates, signatures, logos, company names, free-form medical text.
- **HEIC** photos aren't decodable by browsers – convert to JPG/PNG first.
- **PDFs** are limited to 60 pages and become image-only.
- **Performance:** first scan loads ~15 MB of models. Face detection uses WebGL when available; on machines without GPU acceleration it falls back to CPU and can take a while on big images.
- Filenames aren't scrubbed beyond adding `-redacted`. If your filename contains your name, rename it.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                   # unit tests (rules, box mapping, metadata, redaction cell size) — under a second
npm run test:e2e:setup                     # one-time: download Chromium for Playwright
npm run build && npm run preview &         # then:
npm run test:e2e -- http://localhost:4173/ # full pipeline in headless Chromium
npm run test:e2e:ci                        # all of the above in one go: install Chromium, build, serve, test (used by the manual E2E workflow)
```

The e2e test drives the real UI against the **production build** (so the CSP is enforced) and asserts:

- every category is detected on the sample pay stub (email, phones, SSN, addresses, card, account/routing, DOB, face, QR + barcode)
- the exported PNG can no longer be OCR'd for any secret, while normal text remains readable
- a JPEG with **GPS + camera model** comes out with no EXIF segment
- a 2-page PDF with a real text layer and author metadata comes out with **no selectable secret text and an empty info dictionary**
- **zero** requests to external origins and zero console errors / CSP violations

All sample data is fictional (`4242 4242 4242 4242` is a public test card number; the portrait is AI-generated). Regenerate with `npm run samples`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Optional local **name / organisation detection** (small on-device NER model)
- [ ] Batch mode – drop a folder, get a folder
- [ ] Watch-folder / clipboard-monitor mode for the desktop app
- [ ] More locales (EU addresses & national IDs, IBAN validation, non-Latin OCR packs)
- [ ] License-plate & signature detectors
- [ ] "Keep text selectable" PDF mode using true content-stream redaction
- [ ] Browser extension: right-click any image → privacy-redact
- [ ] Installable PWA (a web manifest ships already; offline service worker still to do)
- [ ] Custom rules (bring your own regex / keywords, e.g. an employee-ID format)

## FAQ

**Does anything get uploaded?** No. There is no backend. Open your browser's Network tab and see for yourself — after the page loads, dropping a file causes zero requests.

**Why not just blur it in Preview / Paint?** You can, but you have to spot every item yourself, get the boxes right, and remember that the file's EXIF/GPS data is still there. privacy-redact does the spotting and the scrubbing.

**Is PNG/JPG export lossless / does it change my image?** PNG is lossless. JPG is re-encoded at quality 93. Colour profiles are dropped (part of metadata stripping), which may shift colours very slightly on wide-gamut photos.

**Can I add my own patterns?** Yes — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-detection-rule). It's one object in `patterns.js`.

**Why is the first scan slow?** The OCR engine and face model load on first use, then get reused for the rest of the session.
